## Tom

### Meeting with Swann Pararnau about Argo - Decaf integration

Relevant parts of argo for decaf:

- Info from system about architecture
    - availability and type of resources (nodes, network, storage)
    - to help automatically configure decaf
- Execution model (3-level tree)
    - level 0: argo master
    - level 1: jobs (world communicator to us)
    - level 2: enclaves (producer, dataflow, consumer to us)
- Communication model
    - Global information bus (GIB)
        - Beacon pub/sub service for fault notifications (Franck)
        - Expose service for performance monitoring
        - Other user communications services (Swann)

We need MPI to be one of the user communication services on the GIB

### Public docs

- All uploaded and ready for PI meeting next week
    - poster
    - handout
    - talk
    - quad chart

### Hiring

- Interviewed Matthieu Dreher
- Extended an offer
- Serving on his PhD committee

### Code

- Working with Lokman on splitting / merging datatypes
- Integrated python for top level interface (last time)
- Need to finish one more feature for same-process put-get (ongoing)

## Upcoming

- Tom will meet with Jay next week in Walnut Creek at the PI meeting
- Next regular meeting 1/21/15

## Florin

Claris implementation
redesigned I/O stack
implement collective I/O methods with these abstractions
- performance problem writing to aggregator nodes, due to static partition mismatch with GPFS lock domains
- implemented dynamic partitioning

advantages
- abstractions enable new optiomizations, prgrammability
- use GIB information to optimize claris

## Lokman

- Will update HACC instructions
- See [slides](../../individual-docs/lokman-slides-010715.pdf)about data management layer
- Finish example, merging received data, and moving details from the example down into decaf, hiding from user
- Will eventually want to wrap EVPath datatypes in the same API
- Research: eventually look for better way to specify datatypes
    - C++ does not have introspection (not C++11 or C++14)
    - python has introspection, another reason to make the data definition layer in the python high-level interface

## Jay

- Hobbes design similar to Argo
- GIB is unified between Hobbes and Argo (on purpose)
- Dug up Fireworks and Tigres (LBNL workflow systems), will upload info soon
- Data model permanency: Note that while an entire data model for a code may not change very often, codes can easily select subsets of variables to compute and output, and this changes for potentially every run. Hence, the data model even for a simulation can be quite dynamic, at least between runs.

## Patrick

- EVPath has some introspection capability, need to learn more how this is done
- Working on expanding EVPath example to a more realistic example
    - based on Hobbes application use cases
    - hope to use this example to do performance testing in Nessie/MPI stack
    - looking at python interface also, consensus that high-level interface should be python

## Hadrien

- Recap: analyzing different methods to detect soft errors
- Comparing methods, metrics for that comparison
- Working on injecting errors and see if we can detect them
     - working with Leo and Franck
