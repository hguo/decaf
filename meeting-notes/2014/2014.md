# 9/3/14

## Repository
- bitbucket
- development forks (todo)
- documentation
- CMake build system

## Wiki
- markdown format

## Staffing
- Patrick Widener is SNL staff developer on the project (added to mailing list)
- I posted an ANL postdoc position and am skyping one candidate from Austria on Monday

## Scope, technical topics, first steps (in no particular order)
- Develop pipeliner primitive.
- Demonstrate HACC->tess->dense in decaf
- Buffer mismatched data rates, develop buffer primitive
- Develop data description layer
- Develop soft error detection
- Start designing base classes (Tom)
- Understand existing tools and their possibility for reuse, in particular the MxN nature of those tools (Jay)
- Meet and understand relationship between DIY datatypes and file views (Tom, Florin)
- View approach for collectives for MPICH; data staging using double buffering; view, buffering, collective I/O based on views (Florin)

## Platform, tools:
- I will start with prototypes in MPI and DIY, using separate communicators to emulate different jobs
- Jay will work in C/C++ and Nessie (hidden from user)
- Florin in C

## Upcoming:
- I will miss the next meeting
- Florin to take paternity leave any time now

# 10/1/14

## Tom: Personnel update
- Guillaume Aupy, postdoc working on resilience modeling
- Lokman Rahmani, student starting next week and staying at ANL for 3 months, background in Damaris
- Skyping postdoc candidate next week

## Tom: Software upstate
- Decaf wrappers around transport layer implementations of datatype and communicator
- I'm working in a partition of a single application and world communicator into producer, dataflow, and consumer ranks, and forming of producer-dataflow and dataflow-consumer communicators
- Dataflow is an intermediate area between producer and consumer. Data moves in 2 steps producer->dataflow and dataflow->consumer.
- Selection / aggregation is also a 2-step process: prod_selector and con_selector functions are defined by the user and they filter everything going into and out of the dataflow.
- example of usage in examples/direct.cpp
- documentation contains notes on the above items
- code contains the details
- next up: pipelining

## Jay: Trilinos
- provides transport layer abstractions as well
- will evaluate whether we can use them and report back

## Jay: GT's EVPath
- For coupling separate independent applications
- Should be about 70% of the way there for what we need

## Jay: applications
- In a couple of weeks there will be a Hobbes code-athon; will have real examples of simulations there.

## Fault tolerance:
- Jay: reminiscent of transactions project. How do you know that you haven't lost anything, no errors occurred?
- Franck: another next step can be to define the criticality of data in the data model.

## Next Meeting: October 15
- Tom will be on travel, will try to call in.
