# Welcome

Welcome to the Decaf project wiki. It consists of meeting notes, common documents and notes, and individual space for PIs to upload materials. All content should be assumed to be public.

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. A sample markdown home page (the one provided by bitbucket) can be found [here][sample].
[sample]: sample.md

The wiki itself is a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back. The wiki URL is the same as the source code project, with /wiki appended to the name:

```
$ git clone https://tpeterka1@bitbucket.org/tpeterka1/decaf.git/wiki
```
