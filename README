Building decaf:

Decaf is built using CMake. Assuming that you created an install directory one level below the decaf home directory, then:

cd install

Here is a sample cmake command line. We recommend saving this into a script and running the script:

cmake .. \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx \
-Ddebug=on \
-Doptimize=off \
-Dtransport_mpi=on \

Currently, the available options are:
debug              "Build Decaf with debugging on"                OFF/ON, default OFF
optimize           "Build Decaf with optimization"                OFF/ON, default OFF
transport_mpi      "Build Decaf with MPI transport layer"         ON/OFF, default ON

Building your project with decaf:

Simply,

#include <decaf/decaf.hpp>
