\section{Introduction}

With the increass in size and complexity of modern HPC plateforms, resiliency
and error detections is concidered as a key component of new dataflow managers.
\todo{...}

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of silent errors produced by memory
corruption in unstructured data in linear pipeline. Linear pipeline, as they do
not have loop, do not have a temporal dimension and are therefore not subject to
time differetiation and machine learning based detectors. We also focused on
unstructured data, such as particles clouds, as corruption in thoses is not
likely to cause hard errors. Futhermore, hardware errors are likely to corrupt
such datasets.

We focus our study on \todo{number} pipelines used in real HPC applications,
building a memory corruption injection model and metrics for results quality
evaluation.\todo{...}
