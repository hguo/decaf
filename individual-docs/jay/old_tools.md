There is a lot of existing work to consider when working on many of the tools for Decaf. These documents, while old, describe them.

The ECho paper describes the precursor to EVPath and the inclusion of the data manipulation functionality incorporated.

The IO paper describes in more detail the data encoding work.

The ICDCS 2006 submission covers the automatic data conversion services Jay worked on in 2005. This was rejected, but the work has continued since then.

The XMIT paper is the automatic type generation system. This is an HPDC paper from 2001.
