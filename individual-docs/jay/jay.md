Workflow application examples:

Hobbes is using these and we can use them as well:

1. SNAP - LANL proxy app for PARTISN code (https://github.com/losalamos/SNAP)
2. LAMMPS - Sandia MD code + SmartPointer or other analytics elements (http://lammps.sandia.gov/)
3. GTC-P - PIC fusion simulation + analytics routines, but may be difficult to share properly. There are some restrictions.
